1. Get the orginal data csv (without repeating) (Pranesh)
2. All band model
3. Generate pusedo count data


4. Think of a new way to fuse the latent space? (CHIRAG)



#Current moedl (LC,NDVI, Numeric) - exisitng balancing techqiue
Current model (LC, NDVI, Numeric)- Pusedo count data which generated

Model (LC, NDVI, RGB, Numeric) - with existing data balanced
Model (LC, NDVI, RGB, Numeric) - with pusedo count.



Pusedo Plan1:
Numeric data for all the points around the presence (with threshold distance) (Pranesh)
Auto-encoder (decide which?)
Create cluster, label the cluster with availble presence count.
And assign the counts to the cluster based on disatnce(Elimintaing threshold physical distance)

Then we will tain the Model


Plan2:
